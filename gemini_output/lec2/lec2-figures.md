Okay, I have extracted the text from lec2-figures.pdf. Due to the nature of the document (a PDF primarily containing images), the transcription consists mainly of titles, headings, some URLs, and a few code snippets. I have included "==Start of OCR for page X==" and "==End of OCR for page X==" to denote page boundaries.
